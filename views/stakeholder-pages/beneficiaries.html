                    <div class="mt-4">
                        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">In 2002, Genalyn started attending our preschool at the age of six. However, she had to leave school in 2011 after her mother passed away to help support her family. Her father is elderly, and one of her brothers has a disability.</p>
                        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed mt-4">She used to work as a maid for a family, earning only 40 euros per month with just two days off. However, in March 2013, we convinced her to return to school. As part of our scholarship program, she now works for us in the mornings, assisting our social workers for the same pay. In the afternoons, we sponsor her to attend high school, where she excels and is currently at the top of her class!</p>
